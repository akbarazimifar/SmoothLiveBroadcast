# Smooth Live Streaming Encoder
Live streaming encoder with automatic bitrate control.
  
# Abstract
No more wondering what bitrate to choose for your live streaming to Twitch, YouTube, or any other RTMP server.
Smooth Live Streaming Encoder resolves the biggest problem in live broadcasting - freezing video caused by network congestion. 
That is achieved by automatic bandwidth detection and  adjusting the bitrate dynamically. 
As a result, the streaming suffers from less dropping frames in ever changing network conditions.
That guarantees optimal video quality while broadcasting to any public streaming service, like Twitch or YouTube.
